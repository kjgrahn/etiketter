NAME
       etiketter - typeset labels for herbarium specimens

SYNOPSIS

       etiketter [-o file] file.xlsx
       etiketter [-o file] < csv
       etiketter --version
       etiketter --help

DESCRIPTION

       etiketter  lets  you  print labels for herbarium specimens,
       based on information extracted from  Artportalen.  It  also
       lets  you  edit  the information first. The result could be
       something like:

              FLORA SUECICA

              Asplenium septentrionale (L.) Hoffm.         72765291
              gaffelbräken

              Västergötland, Mölndal
              brant i vägkant NO om f d Blixås crossbana, Mölndal
              6395290 1273650 (±10m) RT90 2.5 gon

              2 ex kvar i en något högre klippa som inte täcktes
              av lermassorna.

   Data formats
       Artportalen's feature for data export generates Excel 2007+
       documents, known by the filename extension .xlsx. etiketter
       can  read  such  a document directly, if Dilshod Temirkhod-
       jaev's xlsx2csv(1) is installed. If it's not, it  can  read
       CSV  data,  but this needs to be CSV data on the form where
       all  cells  are  quoted  and  separated  by   comma,   e.g.
       "foo","bar","baz" ...

       The  output  from  etiketter  is  groff (or roff, or troff)
       source code (or typesetting markup). That is, a  text  file
       mixing  text  to be printed, with formatting commands. When
       typeset by groff(1) to PDF or Postscript, it's a series  of
       smallish  landscape  mode  pages,  with one label per page.
       Hopefully a printer can be told to print four or  eight  of
       these per A4 paper, so you don't waste paper.

       You may, of course, edit the data in Artportalen, in Excel,
       in the csv file, or in the output from etiketter. Your  Ex-
       cel export is likely to include entries for which you don't
       have a herbarium specimen; you probably want  to  edit  the
       Excel  sheet  itself to eliminate these. Or perhaps you cut
       and paste lines to a new sheet.
