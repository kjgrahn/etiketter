NAME
       etiketter - typeset labels for herbarium specimens

SYNOPSIS
       etiketter [-o file] file.xlsx
       etiketter [-o file] < file.xlsx
       etiketter --version
       etiketter --help

DESCRIPTION
       etiketter  lets  you  print labels for herbarium specimens,
       based on information extracted from  Artportalen.  It  also
       lets  you  edit  the information first. The result could be
       something like:

              FLORA SUECICA

              Asplenium septentrionale (L.) Hoffm.         72765291
              gaffelbräken

              Västergötland, Mölndal
              brant i vägkant NO om f d Blixås crossbana, Mölndal
              6395290 1273650 (RT90, ±10m)

              2 ex kvar i en något högre klippa som inte täcktes
              av lermassorna.

   Data formats
       Artportalen's feature for data export generates Excel 2007+
       documents, known by the filename extension .xlsx. etiketter
       can read such documents directly.

              Earlier  versions  relied on an external utility for
              this, and could also read CSV data. This didn't  al-
              ways work well, and is no longer supported.

       The  output  from  etiketter  is  groff (or roff, or troff)
       source code (or typesetting markup). That is, a  text  file
       mixing  text  to be printed, with formatting commands. When
       typeset by groff(1) to PDF or Postscript, it's a series  of
       smallish landscape mode pages, with one label per page.

       You may, of course, edit the data in Artportalen, in Excel,
       or in the output  from  etiketter.  Your  Excel  export  is
       likely  to  include  entries  for  which  you  don't have a
       herbarium specimen; you probably want  to  edit  the  Excel
       sheet  itself  to  eliminate  these. Or perhaps you cut and
       paste lines to a new sheet.
